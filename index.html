          <p>I'm on my 5th week at Cazfit and this is the first time in my life
          I've ever looked forward to exercise! Caz is such a fantastic and
          knowledgable instructor and makes sure you do everything properly so
          that you feel you're getting the most out of your session. I feel SO
          much fitter than when I started and have lost 3.2 kgs so far, but
          probably much more in centimeters because I can definitely feel the
          difference in the way my clothes fit. Apart from the exercise she also
          gives you a great meal plan and some awesome tips too. I would
          recommend Cazfit to anyone, no matter what your fitness level!</p>
